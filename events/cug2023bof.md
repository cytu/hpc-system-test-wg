# Cray User Group 2023 Birds of a Feather

## HPC System Test: Challenges and Lessons Learned Deploying Bleeding-Edge Network Technologies

### Description
 
In the last couple of years, CUG sites across the world have begun deploying and testing the latest generation of HPE/Cray EX systems including Perlmutter at NERSC (USA), LUMI at CSC (Finland), Frontier at ORNL (USA), Setonix at PAWSEY (Australia), among others. In this birds of a feather session, we aim to gather center and vendor staff from across the globe to describe deployment processes used, discuss challenges encountered, and share lessons learned during the deployment of HPE's Slingshot technology at different scales. The session will first feature speakers from HPE Engineering and ORNL HPC Scalable Systems teams which will be followed by an interactive discussion to encourage participants to share their own experiences. 

The session will focus on these primary goals: (1) identify common challenges across sites, (2) gather information on tests and tools that could be leveraged by the community, and (3) define and share best practices that can be used to validate functionality, performance, and stability of Slingshot based systems.

### Invited Speakers 

#### Forest Godfrey (HPE)
Forest Godfrey is a Distinguished Technologist at HPE and is one of the software architects for Slingshot software. After attaining a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University, Forest's 23 year career at HPE, Cray and SGI, has involved working on a number of supercomputer platforms in the areas of OS Kernel, system management, and overall system architecture. He holds 13 patents in the field of high performance computing.

#### Matt Ezell (ORNL)
Matt Ezell is a high performance computing systems engineer at the Oak Ridge Leadership Facility (OLCF) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). His team is responsible for the deployment and day-to-day operation of the OLCF’s largest HPC resources. Matt is also the technical lead for the Frontier supercomputer, ORNL's exascale system currently first in the TOP500 list (November 2022).


### Moderators
