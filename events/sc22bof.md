# SC22 Birds of a Feather
## HPC System Testing:  Looking ahead to Post-Exascale Systems and HPC Ecosystems
### Description

This BoF brings together experts from HPC centers around the globe to discuss 
future system testing methodologies. The session will include a panel focusing
on HPC system testing at scale including acceptance testing of Perlmutter, Frontier, 
Fugaku, and LUMI. Panelists will describe challenges faced and share their 
perspectives on how those could have been overcome. Then, we will host two speakers
to spark ideas for the open discussion in which attendees will be invited to 
identify key areas that HPC center staff and vendors should focus on to prepare
for the next-generation of compute and data resources.

BOF attendees will have the opportunity to share their experiences conducting
acceptance and regression testing at their institutions and exchange best
practices with other HPC centers.
