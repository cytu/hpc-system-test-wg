# PEARC 2023 Birds of a Feather

## HPC System Testing: Code Selection for Acceptance/Regression Testing

### Description

Acceptance testing and regression testing are key components for ensuring the functionality, performance, and usability of high-performance computing (HPC) systems. In this Birds of a Feather session, we aim to gather experts from various HPC centers to describe their process for selecting codes for acceptance and regression testing. The session will begin by having panelists from Indiana University, Purdue University, Georgia Tech University, and Texas Advanced Computing Center introduce their center and system(s), describe how they coordinate and manage acceptance/regression testing, and describe their approach for selecting test codes. Talks will be followed by open discussion and Q&A. As a part of this session, we hope to identify which codes, criteria, and/or selection approaches that centers have found more helpful than others for acceptance/regression testing.
