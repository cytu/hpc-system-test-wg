# Welcome to the HPC System Test Working Group

This working group is a new effort started as a result of a Birds-of-a-Feather session at the Cray User Group 2019. The main goals for this working group are:
1. Share acceptance and regression test procedures.
1. Learn about tools successfully used for testing at various HPC centers.
1. Compile a list of resources and frameworks available for HPC system testing.
1. Gather a collection of tests for different scientific applications and benchmarks that can be shared among the HPC community.
