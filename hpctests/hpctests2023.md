# HPCTESTS 2023 Workshop 

## Description

This workshop brings together HPC researchers, practitioners, and vendors from around the globe to present and discuss state-of-the-art HPC system testing methodologies, tools, benchmarks, tests, procedures, and best practices. The increasing complexity of HPC architectures requires a larger number of tests in order to thoroughly evaluate the status of the system after its installation or before a software upgrade is applied to production systems. Therefore, HPC centers and vendors use different methodologies to evaluate their systems during its lifetime, not only at the beginning during the installation and acceptance time, but also regularly during maintenance windows. This workshop will provide a venue to present and discuss the latest HPC system test technologies and methodologies including, but not limited to, tools used for testing, new test suites and benchmarks developed to assist testing efforts, lessons learned from acceptance and regression testing experiences, and evaluations of new hardware and software that showcase testing best practices. 

The event will include a keynote focused on current HPC system testing topics, followed by a series of paper presentations from peer-reviewed accepted submissions, and will conclude with a panel discussion.
